**Project Status:**

I have completed the necessary modifications to address the `mensa_chroma` container issue.

1.  **`docker-compose.yml` updated:** The ChromaDB image version has been updated to `0.5.15`, and the volume configuration now uses a bind mount to `./data/chroma`.
2.  **`LATEST_CHANGES.md` created:** This file summarizes the changes made.
3.  **`NEXT_STEPS.md` updated:** This file contains detailed instructions for you to execute, including how to bring up the Docker services and troubleshoot further if needed.

**Next Action Required (from you):**

Please follow the instructions in `NEXT_STEPS.md` to restart your Docker services. I am currently awaiting your action to proceed.
