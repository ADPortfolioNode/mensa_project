Hello,

I've analyzed the network logs you provided. Here's a summary of my findings:

*   **The previous connection issue is resolved.** The backend is now responding correctly, and the application is successfully fetching data from the API (e.g., `/api/startup_status`, `/api/games`, etc.).

*   **The "pending" WebSocket connection (`ws`) is expected behavior.** This connection is used by the frontend development server for Hot Module Replacement (HMR). It allows the application to automatically reload in the browser when you make changes to the code. It is not part of the application's communication with the backend and does not indicate an error.

*   **The Chat functionality is not using WebSockets.** I have reviewed the `ChatPanel.js` component and confirmed that it communicates with the backend using standard HTTP requests, not WebSockets.

In summary, the application appears to be working as expected, and there are no connection errors.

If you are experiencing a specific issue with a feature, please provide more details, and I will be happy to investigate further.
