✅ CMD uses --http h11 flag
```

**File: `backend/main.py`**
```python
✅ Global startup_state dict for tracking
✅ start_background_ingestion() function (daemon thread)
✅ Removed blocking @app.on_event("startup")
✅ Modified /api/startup_status to return real progress
✅ _ingestion_started flag to prevent duplicate threads
✅ asyncio.new_event_loop() for thread-safe async
```

**File: `docker-compose.yml`**
```yaml
✅ Backend healthcheck added (every 10s, 30s start window)
✅ Frontend healthcheck added (every 10s, 30s start window)
✅ Chroma healthcheck improved (start_period: 10s)
✅ depends_on using condition: service_healthy
✅ restart: unless-stopped policy added
```

**File: `start.sh`**

✅ Uses --build flag for image building
✅ Health check waiting loop
✅ Clear access point messages
```

## Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: System Start (Manual - When Docker Available)

**Command:**
```bash
cd "e:/2024 RESET/mensa_project"
./start.sh
```

**Expected Output:**
```
Starting Mensa Project...

Building and starting services (this may take a few minutes on first run)...
[+] Running 3/3
 ✔ Container mensa_chroma created
 ✔ Container mensa_backend created
 ✔ Container mensa_frontend created

Waiting for services to be ready...
✓ Services ready

Container Status:
NAME                   IMAGE                  STATUS
mensa_chroma           chromadb/chroma:0.6.3  Up 30s (healthy)
mensa_backend          mensa_project-backend  Up 25s (healthy)
mensa_frontend         mensa_project-frontend Up 20s (healthy)

✓ Application started

Access your application:
  Frontend: http://localhost:3000
  Backend:  http://localhost:5000/api

View logs:
  docker-compose logs -f
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ✅ All three containers show "healthy" status
- ✅ No error messages in output
- ✅ Startup completes in under 2 minutes

---

### Phase 2: Detailed Monitoring (Optional - For First-Time Verification)

**Command:**
```bash
./monitor_startup.sh
```

**Expected Phases:**
```
Phase 1 (Cleanup):    2-5s
Phase 2 (Build):      1-2 min (code-only) or 12-15 min (first time)
Phase 3 (Health):     10-30s
Phase 4 (Ingestion):  1-5 min (background process)
────────────────────
Total elapsed:        5-10 min first time, 2-3 min subsequent
```

**Sample Output:**
```
[Phase 4] Monitoring background ingestion...
  [24s] Ingesting: take5 (1/8)
  [45s] Ingesting: pick3 (2/8)
  [67s] Ingesting: powerball (3/8)
  [98s] Ingesting: megamillions (4/8)
  ...
```

---

### Phase 3: API Endpoint Testing

**Test 1: Backend Health**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api
```
Expected: `{"message": "Mensa-JE Backend is running"}`

**Test 2: Startup Status**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/startup_status | jq .
```
Expected sample response:
```json
{
  "status": "ingesting",
  "progress": 3,
  "total": 8,
  "current_game": "powerball",
  "current_task": "fetching",
  "games": {
    "take5": "completed",
    "pick3": "completed",
    "powerball": "completed",
    "megamillions": "pending",
    "pick10": "pending",
    "cash4life": "pending",
    "quickdraw": "pending",
    "nylotto": "pending"
  },
  "elapsed_s": 45
}
```

**Test 3: Frontend Accessibility**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:3000 -I
```
Expected: `200 OK` status

**Test 4: Games List (after ingestion completes)**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/games | jq .
```
Expected: List of 8 games with counts

---

### Phase 4: Functional Testing

**Test 1: Game Prediction** (wait for at least 3 games ingested)
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game":"take5","recent_k":10}' | jq .
```
Expected: Prediction data for selected game

**Test 2: Game Training**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/train \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"game":"take5"}' | jq .
```
Expected: Training status response

**Test 3: Chat Endpoint**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text":"What are the latest take5 results?"}' | jq .
```
Expected: Chat response from Gemini

---

### Phase 5: Performance Validation

**Measurement 1: Time to First UI**
```bash
# Run monitor script and note "Phase 3" time
./monitor_startup.sh 2>&1 | grep "✓"

# Expected: UI visible within 60-90 seconds
```

**Measurement 2: Rebuild Speed**
```bash
# Make a minor code change (add a comment)
echo "# test" >> backend/main.py

# Time the rebuild
time docker-compose up -d --build 2>&1 | grep "Build"

# Expected: 2-4 minutes for layer cache hit
```

**Measurement 3: Server Responsiveness**
```bash
# Check when /api endpoint starts responding
watch -n 1 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/api 2>&1 | head -1'

# Expected: Available within 10-30 seconds of container start
```

---

## Monitoring & Observability

### Real-Time Progress Tracking

While startup is in progress:
```bash
# Watch status updates every 2 seconds
watch -n 2 'curl -s http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/startup_status | jq "{status, progress, current_game, elapsed_s}"'

# Follow backend logs
docker-compose logs -f backend | grep -E "Ingesting|✓|✗|Failed"

# Check all container status
docker-compose ps --no-trunc
```

### Health Check Verification

```bash
# Verify all services pass health checks
docker inspect $(docker ps -q) --format='{{.Name}} {{.State.Health.Status}}'

# Expected output:
# /mensa_chroma healthy
# /mensa_backend healthy
# /mensa_frontend healthy
```

### Container Logs Analysis

```bash
# Backend startup logs (should show non-blocking pattern)
docker-compose logs backend | head -50

# Frontend build logs
docker-compose logs frontend | grep -E "webpack|compiled|error"

# Chroma startup (should be quick)
docker-compose logs chroma | head -20
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### Expected Metrics

| Metric | Expected | Actual | Status |
|--------|----------|--------|--------|
| Build time (first) | 12-15 min | _ | ⏳ |
| Build time (code change) | 2-4 min | _ | ⏳ |
| Server responsive | 10-30 sec | _ | ⏳ |
| Frontend visible | 30-40 sec | _ | ⏳ |
| First game ingested | 60-90 sec | _ | ⏳ |
| Full ingestion | 2-5 min | _ | ⏳ |
| Container startup | 10-20 sec | _ | ⏳ |

### Performance Regression Detection

If actual times exceed expected by >30%, investigate:
1. Network bandwidth (pip downloads)
2. Disk I/O (Docker volumes)
3. CPU throttling (resource limits)
4. Network latency (data.ny.gov API)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Issue: Services Won't Start
```bash
# Check Docker daemon
docker ps

# Check disk space
docker system df

# Clean up dangling resources
docker system prune -f

# Rebuild from scratch
docker-compose down -v
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Issue: Slow Build
```bash
# Check network to PyPI
ping pypi.org

# Check pip timeout (already 300s in Dockerfile)
# If still slow, temporarily increase to 600s in Dockerfile

# Use local pip cache (for faster CI/CD)
docker build --build-arg PIP_CACHE_DIR=/cache .
```

### Issue: Ingestion Stuck
```bash
# Check current progress
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/startup_status | jq .current_game, .elapsed_s

# Wait up to 5 minutes (each game ~30-60s)
# If truly stuck, check backend logs:
docker-compose logs backend -f
```

### Issue: Frontend Can't Connect
```bash
# Verify backend is healthy
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/api

# Check frontend logs for API errors
docker-compose logs frontend | grep -E "Error|failed|ERR_"

# Verify REACT_APP_API_BASE is set correctly
docker-compose config | grep REACT_APP_API_BASE
```

## Questions During Testing?

All code changes are in place and fully documented. During testing:

1. Use `docker-compose logs -f` to see real-time output
2. Curl `/api/startup_status` to check ingestion progress
3. Refer to troubleshooting guide above for common issues
4. All new features are backward compatible - no expected regressions

**Expected outcome:** Faster startup, same functionality, better observability.
