Excellent. The environment has been successfully cleaned.

You are now ready to start the application with a clean slate.

**Please run the final command:**

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

This will build fresh images and start the containers. Once it's complete, the Mensa-style gaming platform will be running and accessible at:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

This completes the implementation and troubleshooting process.
