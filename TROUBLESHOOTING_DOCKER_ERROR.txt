The error `unable to get image 'chromadb/chroma:latest': request returned 500 Internal Server Error` indicates a problem with your Docker environment's ability to pull the ChromaDB image from Docker Hub.

As the error message from the startup script suggested, the first and most common solution is to **restart Docker Desktop**.

If a restart does not solve the problem, here are some other things you can try:

1.  **Manually pull the image:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command to try and pull the image directly:
    ```
    docker pull chromadb/chroma:latest
    ```
    This can sometimes provide a more specific error message.

2.  **Check Network / VPN / Firewall:**
    Your network configuration, a VPN, or a firewall could be blocking the connection to Docker Hub. Try temporarily disabling them to see if the pull succeeds.

3.  **Check Docker's Network Settings:**
    Go to Docker Desktop's settings, find the "Network" section, and ensure the DNS is configured correctly. You can try switching to a public DNS server like Google's (`8.8.8.8`).

4.  **Check Docker Daemon Logs:**
    The Docker daemon logs might contain more detailed information about the error. You can find the logs in Docker Desktop's "Troubleshoot" section.

5.  **ChromaDB on Docker Hub:**
    You can find more information about the image, including available tags, on the official ChromaDB Docker Hub page: https://hub.docker.com/r/chromadb/chroma

After trying these steps, run the startup command again. If the problem persists, it is likely an issue with your local Docker installation or network environment.
