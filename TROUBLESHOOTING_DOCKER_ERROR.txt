I see you are having an issue with Docker. The error message `request returned 500 Internal Server Error for API route` suggests that there might be a problem with your Docker Desktop installation.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1.  **Check Docker Desktop Status:** Make sure that Docker Desktop is running and that the Docker daemon is available. You can usually see the Docker icon in your system tray.

2.  **View Container Logs:** To get more information about why the `mensa_backend` container is failing, please run the following command in your terminal:

    ```
    docker-compose logs -f mensa_backend
    ```

    This will show the logs for the backend service. Please copy and paste the output of this command in your next message.

3.  **Restart Docker Desktop:** Sometimes, a simple restart of Docker Desktop can resolve these kinds of issues.

4.  **Check Docker Version:** Please run the following commands and provide me with the output:

    ```
    docker version
    docker-compose version
    ```

    This will help me determine if there is a version mismatch between your Docker client and server.

I am here to help you troubleshoot this issue. Please provide me with the information I requested, and we can work together to resolve it.
